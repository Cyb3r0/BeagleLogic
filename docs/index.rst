Welcome to BeagleLogic!
=======================================

.. note:: Introducing `BeagleLogic Standalone <http://standalone.beaglelogic.net>`_!

          BeagleLogic Standalone is a turnkey logic analyzer that offers
          16 logic channels and Gigabit Ethernet, better than a combination of
          BeagleLogic cape + BeagleBone Black.

Thank you for choosing BeagleLogic! BeagleLogic is a 100Msps logic analyzer
that runs on the BeagleBone including BeagleBone Black, Green and Green Wireless.

The core of the logic analyzer is the 'beaglelogic' kernel module that reserves
memory for and drives the two Programmable Real-Time Units (PRU) via the
remoteproc interface wherein the PRU directly writes logic samples to the
System Memory (DDR RAM) at the configured sample rate one-shot or continuously
without intervention from the ARM core.

BeagleLogic can be used stand-alone for doing binary captures
without any special client software like this::

    dd if=/dev/beaglelogic of=mydump bs=1M count=1

The above commands grab a binary dump at the specified samplerate using the
sysfs attributes.

When used in conjunction with the `sigrok <http://www.sigrok.org/>`_ library,
BeagleLogic supports software triggers and decoding over 70 different digital
protocols. Since the BeagleLogic bindings for libsigrok have been merged
upstream, the latest built-from-source sigrok libraries and tools support
capturing from BeagleLogic.

BeagleLogic also offers a web interface `(demo) <http://beaglelogic.github.io/webapp>`_
which, once installed on the BeagleBone, can be accessed from port 4000 and can
be used for low-volume captures (upto 3K samples). It makes BeagleLogic a useful
tool for beginners as a learning tool about digital protocols.

Core Specifications:

    * **Sample Rate:** 10Hz to 100MHz
    * **Sample Size:** 8-bit or 16-bit (14 usable on the BeagleBone Black,
      BeagleLogic Standalone supports all 16 channels)
    * **Sample Depth**: Depends on the free RAM in the system. Starting from a
      minimum of 8 MB upto 320 MB of the system RAM can be reserved for
      BeagleLogic operation.
    * **Sampling Mode**: One-Shot or Continuous Sampling, software-triggered
      [in conjunction with sigrok] . *Please Note: Continuous Sampling is
      subject to constraints on the link between the RAM and secondary
      storage/PC and CPU processing time before buffers begin to be dropped.*
